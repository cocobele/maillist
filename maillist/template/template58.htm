<DIV style="FONT-SIZE: 1px; TEXT-ALIGN: center">Evolutionary ideas appear in 
many zhangplaces in Dennett's 656A|hdsf-fum3fuearlier writings; he is one of 
zhangthe few philosophers who really seems at home with them. In 
656A|hdsf-fum3fuDarwin's Dangerous zhangIdea he turns his attention directly to 
the idea of evolution by natural selection, trying to explain why so zhangmany 
of his fellow 656A|hdsf-fum3fuphilosophers (and even some biologists) have shied 
from accepting its full ramifications. Dennett begins by offering a description 
of zhangDarwinian theory at an abstract philosophical level. He then looks at 
how this perspective sheds light 656A|hdsf-fum3fuon some controversies within 
evolutionary biology, and finally at its consequences outside biology, for 
social and moral philosophy. </DIV>

<DIV align=center style="FONT-SIZE: 1px">zhangDennett is insanely difficult to 
zhangsummarise, because he crams 656A|hdsf-fum3fuso much into his zhangbooks and 
presents much of his most interesting material as digressions. Darwinian 
evolution has 656A|hdsf-fum3fuzhanga huge range of applications (Dennett calls 
it a universal acid) and taking it as his subject gives zhanghim the opportunity 
to range across science and philosophy, 656A|hdsf-fum3fuintroducing bits and 
pieces of all kinds which he has picked up and thinks zhangare worth sharing. 
This results in the volume as a whole being a little disconnected, but more 
locally ideas are logically and clearly 656A|hdsf-fum3fupresented. </DIV>.
